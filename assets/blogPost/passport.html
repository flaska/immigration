<p>Did you know that? You don't want to lose your passport while traveling abroad. Trust me.</p>

<p>The US immigration system has a few bugs. This is one of the major ones.</p>

<p>The problem is this: If you lose your passport with a stamped visa abroad you can't come back into USA until you replace the passport and visa!</p>

<p>Hm.. replacing a passport takes a few weeks. Getting a new visa takes a week or two?? <strong>Wrong!</strong> In order to replace your H1B visa at a US consulate you will need a form <strong>I-797 Notice of Action</strong>. Most of US keep it right next to a passport so in case of a lost/stolen passport it would go with it.</p>

<p>There is a six month waiting period to replace I-797! Yes. <strong>Six months</strong> to wait. During the six months you can't come back to the USA unless you get a visitor visa but you can't work that way.</p>

<p>What to do? You can try to ask your company if you can keep your job while working remotely. Good luck!</p>

<p>Well what to do? Never lose your passport while traveling. Easy? Haha. I highly recommend getting a <strong>waist band</strong> for your passport. I've successfully traveled through India and China sleeping on overnight trains and hostels with shared rooms. You just keep your passport on your body - not in your pocket(!) -at all times</p>

<p>Weist band goes underneath your shirt and therefore is not accessible by thieves.
