<p>Hi, my name is Jakub and I run this project in my free time.<br>
  It was loads of fun to create this project but it costs me money to run it.</p>

<p>There are monthly hosting fees + time to maintain the project.</p>

<p>If you want to help keep this project running I'd be so happy.</p>

<hr>

<p>Please consider donating $5 or $10 and I promise to use the money to keep the project running and improving.</p>

<p>I've started this website on June 12, 2018. I've had my deal of stress & exhaustion with the immigration system too. It went well for me and I wish it will work out for you too if you waiting on a VISA or Green Card.</p>

<p>I always wanted to create some project and this seemed like a great idea. It captured me and I invested some decent time. I've donated a couple hundred dollars into this website (hosting, advertisement & time) but can't invest much more.</p>

<p>Please consider becoming a proud partner of this project. Donations over $10 will be listed on this website (only if you want of course).</p>

<p>Peace!</p>

<p>PS: I have an invisible hamster which might die if I can't afford to feed him     <i class="material-icons">
